# Wacom EC-155 Schematic

Schematic for the Wacom EC-155 tablet mouse, packaged with the Bamboo Fun tablet.
This looks like a normal 3-button wheel mouse, but electrically it's compatible
with the Bamboo Fun's pen.

It's interesting to me because:

- I had one to take apart. Also, they're cheap on eBay.
- The design is all discrete 74xx logic!
- It seems like a good example circuit to teach and learn with.

Here's the good stuff:
